My training method is currently limited to training at your house or outdoors when the weather permits it. I can bring equipment with me including: Dumbbells, a barbell, suspension straps, skipping ropes, target pads, 10 lb. medicine ball, rotating push up handles, resistance bands, foam mats, hard and soft foam rollers, mobility massage balls, a massager roller stick,  a large exercise ball, and more. I want to make quality training possible even for those living on a budget, so if you can only afford to see me once or twice a month I can simply design a proper program every time you need a progression, then leave the training to you after I teach you the movements. Throughout each training session I will provide information on technique, program design, physiology, meal planning and self motivation tips.</div>

I have been training in Muay Thai (Thai Kickboxing), Jiu Jitsu and mixed martial arts more generally, for over seven years. I have three different styles of pads for you to be trained in Muay Thai on, while I hold them for you. If you have space to put down padded mats, that I can bring, we can do Jiu Jitsu training as well. </div>

Philosophy: Physical activity is vital to our well being. If we do not move we will slowly wither away. There are many different ways we can be active, all we have to do is find the ones that we enjoy. I believe that a workout should be fun and functionally unique to each individual’s lifestyle, but it should also require enough physical exertion that we have to push ourselves forward just a little bit each time.<br>
<br>
Mission: To help you on your way to achieving your fitness goals by finding out what it is that you want and what the best and most fun way for you to do that is.<br>
